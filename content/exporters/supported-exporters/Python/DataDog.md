## Introduction
[Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) is a real-time monitoring system that supports distributed tracing and monitoring.

## Creating the exporter
To create the exporter, we'll need:
* Datadog credentials which you can get from [Here](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/)
* Create an exporter in code

You can find examples of using the OpenCensus Python Datadog exporter [here](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-python/tree/master/contrib/opencensus-ext-datadog/examples).

## Viewing your metrics
